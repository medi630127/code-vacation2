        <h2>Sites</h2>
        <p>In Puerto Rico there are many sites to visit.</p>
        <p>During my summer vacation I visited El Morro, El Yungue and the Bioluminesent Bay.</p>
        
        <h2>El Morro</h2>
        
        <p>El Morro is a an army fort used to protect the Island during wartime in the 1800's.  It was actually build to protect the island from airborne enemies. It is a historic National Historic Site and one of the top attractions in Puerto Rico.</p>
        
        <h2>El Yungue</h2>
        
        <p>El Yungue is one of the few tropical rainforest left in the world.</p>
        <p>From the visitor center a walkway winds through the surrounding treetops. Trails run to La Mina waterfall and mount Britton then up to the high altitude dwarf forest.</p>
        <p> The rainforest is home to over 200 species of trees and plants, 23 of which cannot be found nowhere else.</p>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Bioluminesent Bay</h2>
        
        <p>The Bioluminesent Bay is Puerto Rico's and the world's brightest bioluminescent bay.  It contains upto 160,000 microscopic dinoflagelates in its waters. Tours to see the beauty and science of the bay waters are conducted at night while kayaking.</p>

        <h2>Foods</h2>
        <p>While on vacation we ate out often and were able to taste many different foods.</P>

        <p>On another day while climbing high in the mountains in El Yungue we ate alcapurias and surullitos.</p>
